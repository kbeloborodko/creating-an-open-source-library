# Open Source Library Template
- A project that serves as a boilerplate for an open source library, that includes webpack, npm scripts, unit tests, code coverage and more...
- This project contains a list of Breaking Bad characters names, so you can use **all** property on a module to get a complete list or **random** method to get one random name at a time. Hope you enjoy the library!
